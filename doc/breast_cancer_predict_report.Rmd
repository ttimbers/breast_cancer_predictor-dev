# Summary

# Introduction

# Methods

## Data
The data used to train and test the breast cancer predictive model was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@Dua2019] and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), specifically [this file](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data). Only the following 11 variables were used in the analysis:

- class
- maximum area
- maximum compactness
- maximum concave_points
- maximum concavity
- maximum fractal_dimension
- maximum perimeter
- maximum radius
- maximum smoothness
- maximum symmetry
- maximum texture

## Analysis
The k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) algorithm was used to build a classification model to predict whether a tumour mass was benign or malignant (found in the class column of the data set). The remaining 9 variables listed above were used as predictors in the model. The hyperparameter $K$ was chosen using 10-fold cross validation with overall classification accuracy as the loss function. The R and Python programming languages [@R; @Python] and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis: caret [@caret], docopt [@docopt], feather [@feather], knitr [@knitr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], docopt [@docoptpython], os [@Python], feather [@feather] Pandas [@mckinney-proc-scipy-2010]. The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found here: https://github.com/ttimbers/breast_cancer_predictor.
